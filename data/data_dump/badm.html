<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course provides students with a clear conceptual understanding of the opportunities and challenges involved with international business transactions. Young managers face a diverse set of circumstances when they engage in cross-border business (trade and foreign direct investment) as opposed to purely domestic business: e.g., enhanced globalization forces, cross-national heterogeneity in institutions and cultures, increased competition from emerging economies, and - particularly germane for this course - altered strategic economic incentives. Accordingly, we will attempt to analyze these issues, make sense of the fundamental forces behind these dynamics, and understand their managerial implications. The class will focus then on the roots of International Business, and complement this focus with important practical implications and 'real-world' examples and cases - the ambition will always be to wed good theory with practice. 2 graduate hours.

<p class="courseblockdesc">
Organizations are political systems, so leadership is a political task that raises practical, ethical, and personal challenges. This course aims to help students better understand power in organizations and to become more effective political actors in their professional careers. The course will address normative questions about power's legitimate purposes and the ethical constraints which should govern its use. We will also consider how the pursuit and attainment of power can affect people. In addition, the course will explore the nature of leadership and its relationship to power. Leadership, as we shall come to see in the course of the class, is an inherently ethical and personal concept. The course considers both realism and idealism, both &quot;getting things done&quot; and &quot;doing the right thing.&quot; The course involves reading a large number of cases and attempting to learn from the experiences of successful and failed organizational politicians/leaders. We will also draw upon a large body of popular management literature and social scientific research which has directly addressed the phenomena of power and leadership in and around organizations. The course will be highly interactive and discussion-based. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Prerequisite: Enrollment in the MBA, PMBA, or MSTM program.<br />
