<p class="courseblockdesc">
Introduces a Health Impact Assessment (HIA), a public health tool used to consider the potential health impacts of prospective plans, programs, and policies that may not conventionally include health outcomes in the decision-making process. Students will learn the values and principles underpinning HIA, the steps required to complete an HIA and appropriate methods and approaches for each step. While historically employed in policy evaluation, public health, and community planning, HIA is a new tool to consider at the scale of site and building design. Students will develop capacity to employ this tool during pre-design and in the design process for architectural projects. Through this course, students will gain an understanding of the importance of engaging a breadth of project target audiences in the HIA process, as well as the use of HIA as a tool to address health inequities across impacted groups. Students will undertake an HIA project. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course adds an academic dimension to professionally supervised field experiences in which problems in architectural design and technology are defined, researched, and solved. Advanced doctoral students are introduced to applied research processes in any of architecture's sub-disciplines. Sites of applied research may include commercial firms, not-for-profit organizations, and government agencies. Students work in school-approved firms or agencies of their choice. Written accounts of work accomplished, documentation of research questions developed and pursued, and reflective experiential learning reports must be submitted for evaluation. Field experiences may be part time or full time. 0 graduate hours. No professional credit. Approved for S/U grading only. May be repeated for up to 11 months total of training. This course is intended to facilitate CPT in professionally focused environmental design research for students in the PhD program.
