<p class="courseblockdesc">
Education is in a state of flux - transitioning from traditional architectures and practices to new ecologies of teaching and learning influenced by the tremendous social and technological change of our times. What changes are afoot today in workplaces, civic life and everyday community life? What are their implications for education? What are the possible impacts of contemporary social transformations on teaching and learning - including in the areas of technology, media, globalization, diversity, changing forms of work in the &quot;knowledge society&quot;, and, in these contexts, changing learner needs and sensibilities? This course explores three pedagogical paradigms: &quot;didactic&quot;, &quot;authentic&quot; and &quot;transformative&quot; learning. It takes a historical perspective in order to define the contemporary dimensions of what we term &quot;new learning&quot;. It prepares participants to make purposeful choices and link particular theories/instructional approaches to individual and group learning goals. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing education priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debates is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. 4 graduate hours.
