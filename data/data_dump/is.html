Model types will include decision trees, linear models, nearest neighbor methods, and others as time permits. We will cover classification and regression using these models, as well as methods needed to handle large datasets. Lastly, we will discuss deep neural networks and other methods at the forefront of machine learning.

<p class="courseblockdesc">
From passwords to email encryption to privacy settings on social media services, it is widely recognized that human factors, usability or user experience play a crucial role in effective privacy and security solutions. Designers of privacy and security solutions need to understand how people might use, interact or appropriate the mechanisms they develop. This course introduces various aspects of user experience (e.g., usability problems, user interface designs, conflicting needs) related to privacy and security systems. It is also designed to provide students with knowledge and opportunities to analyze and evaluate user experience of privacy and security systems. This course is suitable for students who are interested in privacy and security, or user experience, or both!.<br />

Human culture provides an ideal testbed for students exploring data science, because the interpretive challenges that lurk beneath the surface in other domains become starkly visible here. For instance, cultural materials usually come to analysts as unstructured texts, images, or sound files, forcing explicit decisions about data modeling and feature extraction. Cultural questions also highlight the importance of interpreting statistical models in relation to a social context. Last but not least: songs, poems, and stories confront us with vivid problems that are inherently fun to explore. This course will start by reviewing descriptive and inferential statistics, and build up to applications of supervised and unsupervised machine learning. We will apply those methods to a range of cultural materials using them to model the pace of stylistic change in popular music, for instance, and the representation of gender in fiction. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.

This enables developers to show how their envisaged working interactive technology will be used productively in a particular real-life context. Communicating the vision of computational devices is a challenge because dynamic use in context is hard for people other than the device's developers to imagine. The ability to produce convincing, clear, powerful demonstrations even at the early stages of a project is a highly valuable entrepreneurial skill, and also highly applicable within an organization.

<p class="courseblockdesc">
A dramatic increase in computing power has enabled new areas of data science to develop in statistical modeling and analysis. These areas cover predictive and descriptive learning and bridge between ideas and theory in statistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. We will cover methods including predictive learning: estimating models from data to predict future outcomes. Regression topics include linear regression with recent advances using large numbers of variables, smoothing techniques, additive models, and local regression. Classification topics include linear regression, regularization, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, splines, support vector machines, generalized additive models, naive Bayes, mixture models and nearest neighbor methods as time permits. Lastly we develop neural networks and deep learning techniques, bridging the theory introduced in the earlier parts of the class to purely empirical methods.

<p class="courseblockdesc">
A theory of information attempts to articulate clearly and precisely what information is, and what it means to become informed. Theories of information can contribute to the scientific foundations for many important research and practice activities in IS, including data curation, information modeling, information access, digital preservation, and informatics support for science and scholarship. This course, Theories of Information -- A, takes a logic-based approach to investigating the nature of information. Methodologically we draw from a family of methods that might be called formal methods, in contrast to the empirical methods of social and nature science. Formal methods typically make use of concepts from logic, set theory, and discrete mathematics to construct and explore formal systems. Formal methods are widely used in linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. Within the general area of formal methods our approach in this course might be more specifically referred to as conceptual analysis, as it takes the form of a systematic analysis of a concept, namely information. Most of the prior work that is relevant to our analysis is from analytic philosophy, linguistics (especially formal semantics), and computer science (especially knowledge representation and AI). 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Prerequisite: Some familiarity with formal logic would be useful, but is not required. Some familiarity with conceptual modeling (ER or UML diagrams, or RDF/S for instance) would also be useful, but not required.<br />

Data mining refers to the process of exploring large datasets with the goal of uncovering interesting patterns. This process usually involves a number of tasks such as data collection, pre-processing, &amp; characterization; model fitting, selection, &amp; evaluation; classification, clustering, &amp; prediction. Although data mining has its roots in database management, it has grown into a discipline that focuses on algorithm design (to ensure computational feasibility) &amp; statistical modeling (to separate the signal from the noise). It draws heavily upon a variety of other disciplines including statistics, machine learning, operations research, &amp; information retrieval. Will cover the major data mining concepts, principles, &amp; techniques that every information scientist should know about. Lectures will introduce &amp; discuss the major approaches to data mining; computer lab sessions coupled w/assignments will provide hands-on experience with these approaches; term projects offer the opportunity to use data mining in a novel way.
