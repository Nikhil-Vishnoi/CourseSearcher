# CourseSearcher

Simple Cpp course searcher I built after scraping my Universities (UIUC) course catalog. Made this so that I could see classes that teach stuff I am interested in. 

Searches by character to character matching I am planning on adding features to make the searching better in the future. 

Running Program 
./bin/engine
