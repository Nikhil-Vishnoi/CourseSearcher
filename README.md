# CourseSearcher

Simple Cpp course searcher I built after scraping my Universities (UIUC) course catalog. Made this so that I could see classes that teach stuff I am interested in. 

Searches by character to character matching I am planning on adding features to make the searching better in the future. 

If doing a fresh download will need to populate the data_dump inside of the data folder either by unzipping the data_dump.zip file into the data/ folder or by running scraper.py to download a fresh batch of data off the UIUC course catalog. 

Running Program 
./bin/engine
